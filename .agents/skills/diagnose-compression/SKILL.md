## Workflow

### Step 1 -- Probe the Input File

Gather complete metadata about the source file.

**API Call:**
```http
GET /api/probe?path=<encoded_input_path>
```

**Key metrics to capture:**
- `codec`: Source codec name (e.g., `h264`, `hevc`, `prores`, `mjpeg`)
- `bitrate`: Source bitrate in bits/second
- `width` x `height`: Source resolution
- `duration`: Length in seconds
- `size`: File size in bytes
- `format`: Container format (e.g., `mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2`)

**Calculate derived metrics:**
```
bitrateKbps = bitrate / 1000
bitsPerPixelPerFrame = bitrate / (width * height * fps)
```

**Validation Gate:**
- [ ] Probe data retrieved successfully
- [ ] Bitrate value is present and > 0
- [ ] Codec name is identified

---

### Step 2 -- Probe the Output File

If the compressed file exists, probe it for comparison.

**Comparison table to build:**

| Metric       | Input           | Output          | Change  |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Size         | X MB            | Y MB            | -Z%     |
| Bitrate      | X kbps          | Y kbps          | -Z%     |
| Resolution   | WxH             | WxH             | same/?  |
| Codec        | source_codec    | target_codec    |         |
| Duration     | X sec           | Y sec           | same/?  |

### Step 3 -- Identify the Root Cause

Run through this diagnostic decision tree:

#### 3a. Output is LARGER than input

**Most common cause: Already-compressed input with low bitrate**

When the source is already H.264 at (for example) 2500 kbps, and you compress to
H.265 with `balanced` preset targeting 6000 kbps, the output will be LARGER.

The smart bitrate capping system mitigates this:
- `balanced` caps at 70% of input bitrate
- `streaming` caps at 50%
- `small` caps at 40%
- `max` has no cap (by design)

**Check:** Is `sourceBitrate / 1000` < target bitrate for the chosen encoder/preset?

| Encoder              | max     | balanced | small   | streaming |
|----------------------|---------|----------|---------|-----------|
| h264_videotoolbox    | 20000k  | 8000k   | 4000k   | 5000k    |
| hevc_videotoolbox    | 12000k  | 6000k   | 3000k   | 4000k    |

If the source bitrate is already below the target, even after capping, the HW encoder
may produce a larger file because VideoToolbox bitrate targeting is approximate and
tends to overshoot on simple content.

**Other causes of size increase:**
- ProRes output (always larger than H.264/H.265 -- by design, it's a mastering codec)
- Adding audio re-encoding overhead to short clips
- Upscaling resolution (should be blocked by UI, but check)

#### 3b. Output looks BAD (quality loss, artifacts)

**Common causes:**
1. **CRF too high** (SW encoder): CRF 32+ for H.265 or CRF 28+ for H.264 on complex content
2. **Bitrate too low** (HW encoder): For 4K content, even 8000k may be insufficient
3. **Resolution downscale**: Scaling 4K to 720p loses detail
4. **Codec mismatch**: Re-encoding ProRes source to H.264 at "small" preset strips mastering quality
5. **Double compression**: Re-encoding already-compressed H.264 to H.264 accumulates generational loss

**Bits-per-pixel diagnostic:**
```
bpp = bitrate / (width * height * fps)
```
- bpp < 0.05: Likely visible quality loss
- bpp 0.05-0.1: Acceptable for most content
- bpp 0.1-0.2: Good quality
- bpp > 0.2: Excellent quality

#### 3c. Compression barely reduces size

**Common causes:**
1. **Source already well-compressed**: H.264 at CRF ~23 won't compress much further
2. **"max" preset selected**: Designed for quality, not size reduction
3. **ProRes source -> H.264 balanced**: This SHOULD compress well (5-10x reduction typical)
4. **Short clip**: Fixed overhead (headers, keyframes) as percentage of tiny file

### Step 4 -- Recommend a Fix

Based on the diagnosis, suggest specific actions:

| Diagnosis | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Already-compressed H.264, low bitrate | Skip compression or use `small` preset with H.265 |
| ProRes source, output too large | Expected -- ProRes is mastering format. Use H.265 balanced for delivery |
| HW encoder overshooting bitrate | Switch to SW encoder (libx264/libx265) which uses CRF for consistent quality |
| Quality too low | Increase preset from `small` to `balanced` or `max`; or use higher resolution |
| Double compression artifacts | Avoid re-encoding; if needed, use `max` preset to minimize generational loss |
| Bitrate cap not reducing enough | The cap uses ratios (0.7/0.5/0.4); for very low bitrate sources, even the cap may exceed source |

---

### Step 5 -- Verify the Fix

After applying the recommended change, verify:

- [ ] Re-compress with adjusted settings
- [ ] Compare new output size to both original and previous attempt
- [ ] Spot-check quality (playback in preview player)
- [ ] Confirm size reduction meets user expectations

## Deep Knowledge: Why Already-Compressed Files Don't Compress Well

### The Fundamental Problem

Video compression is lossy. Each encode pass:
1. Analyzes motion vectors and spatial frequency
2. Quantizes coefficients (irreversible quality loss)
3. Entropy codes the result

Re-encoding an already-compressed file means:
- The encoder sees the DECODED output (with artifacts baked in)
- It must re-analyze and re-quantize, adding MORE loss
- The "information content" after decode is often higher than the compressed size suggests
  because decoded frames fill in quantized blocks, creating data the encoder must handle

### ProRes vs H.264 Behavior

**ProRes source -> H.264/H.265:**
- Excellent compression expected (5-20x reduction)
- ProRes preserves near-raw quality at very high bitrates (60-300 Mbps)
- Re-encoding to delivery codecs works perfectly

**H.264 source -> H.265:**
- Moderate compression expected (20-40% reduction typical)
- H.265 is more efficient, so re-encoding has genuine benefit
- But if source H.264 is already very low bitrate, gains disappear

**H.264 source -> H.264:**
- Minimal benefit (0-15% at best)
- Risk of quality loss from double compression
- Generally not recommended unless changing resolution or trimming

### VideoToolbox Bitrate Targeting

Apple's VideoToolbox hardware encoder uses a different bitrate control strategy
than software encoders:
- SW encoders (libx264/libx265): Use CRF (Constant Rate Factor) which adapts
  bitrate to content complexity. Simple scenes get low bitrate, complex scenes get high.
- HW encoders (VideoToolbox): Use target bitrate (`-b:v`). The encoder aims for this
  average but overshoots on complex content and undershoots on simple content.

This means VideoToolbox may produce files LARGER than expected for:
- Simple, static content (talking head, slides)
- Already-compressed content with low information density
- Short clips where ramp-up overhead is significant

## Error Reference Table

| FFmpeg Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| `Invalid data found when processing input` | Corrupt file or unsupported codec | Re-download file; try different container |
| `Discarded X frame(s)` | Timestamp discontinuities | Add `-fflags +genpts` before input |
| `Error while opening encoder` | Codec not available or misconfigured | Check `ffmpeg -encoders`; verify VideoToolbox availability |
| `height not divisible by 2` | Odd resolution with certain codecs | Scale filter uses `-2:H` to ensure even dimensions |
| `Avi duration discrepancy` | AVI container issues | Convert to MP4 first, then compress |
| `Too many packets buffered` | Memory pressure during encode | Reduce concurrency from 4 to 2 |
| `Unknown encoder` | FFmpeg built without that codec | Reinstall FFmpeg: `brew reinstall ffmpeg` |
| `Output file is empty` | Encoding failed silently | Check full stderr; likely codec/format incompatibility |
