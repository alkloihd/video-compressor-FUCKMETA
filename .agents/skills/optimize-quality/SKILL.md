## Workflow

### Step 1 -- Probe and Analyze Input

Gather detailed metadata about the source video to understand its characteristics.

**API Call:**
```http
GET /api/probe?path=<encoded_path>
```

**Key analysis points:**

| Property | What It Tells Us |
|----------|-----------------|
| `codec` | Source encoding; affects re-encoding strategy |
| `bitrate` | Current quality level; baseline for improvement |
| `width` x `height` | Resolution determines bitrate needs |
| `fps` | Higher FPS = more data needed |
| `duration` | Affects total file size |

**Content complexity classification:**

| Content Type | Characteristics | Compression Friendliness |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Talking head / podcast | Low motion, simple background | Very friendly (2-4 Mbps sufficient for 1080p) |
| Screen recording | Large static areas, sharp text | Friendly (3-5 Mbps; avoid blur-inducing presets) |
| Action/sports | High motion, fast scene changes | Needs high bitrate (8-15 Mbps for 1080p) |
| Nature/landscapes | High detail, gradual motion | Moderate (5-8 Mbps) |
| Animation | Flat colors, sharp edges | Very friendly (2-4 Mbps) |
| Grain-heavy film | Dense random noise in every frame | Needs high bitrate or denoising (10-20 Mbps) |

**Derived metric -- Bits per pixel per frame (BPP):**
```
bpp = bitrate / (width * height * fps)
```

| BPP Range | Quality Level |
|-----------|--------------|
| < 0.03 | Very low -- visible artifacts likely |
| 0.03 - 0.06 | Low -- acceptable for simple content |
| 0.06 - 0.10 | Medium -- good for most content |
| 0.10 - 0.15 | High -- good for complex content |
| 0.15 - 0.25 | Very high -- excellent quality |
| > 0.25 | Overkill for delivery; fine for mastering |

**Validation Gate:**
- [ ] Probe data retrieved with all fields populated
- [ ] BPP calculated and content type estimated
- [ ] Source codec identified for re-encoding strategy

### Step 2 -- Content-Specific Recommendations

Based on the content analysis, recommend optimal settings.

#### CRF vs Bitrate: When to Use Which

| Approach | Method | Best For | Behavior |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **CRF** (Constant Rate Factor) | SW encoders: `-crf N` | Consistent quality across scenes | Adapts bitrate to content complexity; simple scenes get small files, complex scenes get larger |
| **Target Bitrate** | HW encoders: `-b:v Nk` | Predictable file sizes | Fixed average bitrate; may under/over-allocate for varying complexity |

**When to prefer CRF (software encoding):**
- You care about consistent quality more than exact file size
- Content has varying complexity (mix of static and action)
- You have time to wait (SW encoding is 2-5x slower than HW)
- You need fine-grained quality control

**When to prefer HW encoding (VideoToolbox):**
- Speed matters (4-10x faster than SW)
- You're doing batch processing and need throughput
- File size predictability is acceptable
- Content complexity is relatively uniform

### Step 3 -- Preset Comparison Chart

For the user's specific video, compute estimated outputs for each combination.

#### H.264 Options

| Preset | SW (libx264) | HW (VideoToolbox) | Est. Size (for reference file) |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| max | CRF 18, slow | 20000k target | ~90% of original (SW) |
| balanced | CRF 23, medium | 8000k target | ~60% of original (SW) |
| small | CRF 28, medium | 4000k target | ~35% of original (SW) |
| streaming | CRF 23, fast | 5000k target | ~50% of original (SW) |

#### H.265 Options (Recommended for most use cases)

| Preset | SW (libx265) | HW (VideoToolbox) | Est. Size (for reference file) |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| max | CRF 22, slow | 12000k target | ~80% of original (SW) |
| balanced | CRF 28, medium | 6000k target | ~50% of original (SW) |
| small | CRF 32, medium | 3000k target | ~25% of original (SW) |
| streaming | CRF 28, fast | 4000k target | ~40% of original (SW) |

#### AV1 Options (Best compression ratio, slowest encoding)

| Preset | SW (libsvtav1) | HW | Est. Size (for reference file) |
|--------|---------------|-----|-------------------------------|
| max | CRF 25, preset 4 | N/A | ~70% of original |
| balanced | CRF 30, preset 6 | N/A | ~40% of original |
| small | CRF 38, preset 8 | N/A | ~20% of original |
| streaming | CRF 35, preset 6 | N/A | ~35% of original |

#### ProRes (Mastering only -- files will be LARGER)

| Preset | SW (prores_ks) | HW (VideoToolbox) | Est. Size |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| max | Profile 3 (HQ) | Profile 3 | ~200% of H.264 source |
| balanced | Profile 2 (Standard) | Profile 2 | ~120% of H.264 source |
| small | Profile 1 (LT) | Profile 1 | ~80% of H.264 source |

### Step 4 -- Resolution Impact Analysis

Show how resolution scaling affects both quality and size.

**Pixel count ratios relative to source:**

| Source | -> 1080p | -> 720p | -> 480p | -> 360p |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 4K (3840x2160) | 25% pixels | 11% pixels | 5% pixels | 3% pixels |
| 1440p (2560x1440) | 56% pixels | 25% pixels | 11% pixels | 6% pixels |
| 1080p (1920x1080) | 100% (skip) | 44% pixels | 20% pixels | 11% pixels |
| 720p (1280x720) | (upscale blocked) | 100% (skip) | 44% pixels | 25% pixels |

**File size roughly scales with pixel ratio** (not exactly, due to encoding overhead).

**Quality impact of downscaling:**
- 4K -> 1080p: Minimal perceptible loss on displays < 27"
- 1080p -> 720p: Noticeable softening, acceptable for streaming
- 720p -> 480p: Significant detail loss, only for mobile/bandwidth-constrained
- Any -> 360p: Low quality, only for previews or extreme bandwidth constraints

---

### Step 5 -- Show Estimation and Compare

Present the options to the user with estimated sizes.

**Estimation formula (HW/bitrate-based):**
```
estimatedSize = (adjustedBitrate * 1000 / 8) * duration * pixelRatio
```
Where `adjustedBitrate = min(targetBitrate, sourceBitrate * capRatio)`

**Estimation formula (SW/CRF-based):**
```
estimatedSize = originalSize * compressionRatio * pixelRatio
```

**Color-coded indicators in UI:**
- Green (#4ade80): 20%+ reduction expected
- Gray (#a3a3a3): 0-20% reduction
- Orange (#fb923c): File may get LARGER

**Recommendation summary format:**
```
For your [content type] at [resolution]:
  Best quality:  H.265 max    -> ~X MB (Y% of original)
  Best balance:  H.265 balanced -> ~X MB (Y% of original)  [RECOMMENDED]
  Smallest file: AV1 small    -> ~X MB (Y% of original)
  Fastest:       H.264 HW balanced -> ~X MB (Y% of original)
```

**Verification Step:**
- [ ] All estimations computed correctly
- [ ] Color indicators match expected direction
- [ ] Recommendation accounts for content type
- [ ] HW availability checked for HW-based recommendations

## Deep Knowledge: CRF Values Explained

CRF (Constant Rate Factor) controls quality on a logarithmic scale.

**For libx264:**
- CRF 0: Lossless (huge files)
- CRF 17-18: Visually lossless
- CRF 23: Default, good balance
- CRF 28: Noticeable quality reduction
- CRF 51: Worst possible quality

**For libx265:**
- Same concept but shifted ~6 points (CRF 28 in x265 ~ CRF 23 in x264)
- CRF 22: Visually lossless
- CRF 28: Good balance
- CRF 32: Noticeable reduction

**For libsvtav1:**
- Uses "QP" mode mapped to CRF-like behavior
- CRF 25: Very high quality
- CRF 30: Good balance
- CRF 38: Aggressive compression

**Key insight:** CRF is NOT directly comparable across codecs.
CRF 28 in libx265 produces roughly the same perceptual quality as CRF 23 in libx264,
but at approximately 50% of the file size. AV1 at CRF 30 matches both at even smaller sizes.

## Reference: Encoding Speed Comparison (M2 Max)

Approximate encoding speed for 1080p 30fps content:

| Encoder | Speed (relative to realtime) | 1-hour video encode time |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| h264_videotoolbox | 8-15x realtime | 4-8 minutes |
| hevc_videotoolbox | 5-10x realtime | 6-12 minutes |
| libx264 (medium) | 1.5-3x realtime | 20-40 minutes |
| libx265 (medium) | 0.5-1.5x realtime | 40-120 minutes |
| libsvtav1 (preset 6) | 0.3-0.8x realtime | 75-200 minutes |

**Speed vs Quality tradeoff:**
- HW encoding: Fast, good quality, less size efficiency
- SW encoding: Slow, excellent quality-to-size ratio
- AV1: Very slow, best compression efficiency
