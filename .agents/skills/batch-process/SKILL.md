  Handles processing multiple video files efficiently, including scanning directories,
  grouping files by properties, and queuing batch compression jobs. Use when a user
  wants to compress an entire folder, process multiple files with the same settings,
  or manage a large batch queue.

## Workflow

### Step 1 -- Scan and Collect Files

Identify all video files to process.

**Input methods:**
1. **Drag-and-drop multiple files** into the drop zone (up to 20 via multer)
2. **Path input** with multiple paths separated by `;` or newlines
3. **Directory path** (requires manual listing -- the app processes individual files)

**Supported video extensions:**
```
.mp4 .mkv .avi .mov .webm .wmv .flv .ts .m4v .mts .m2ts
.mpg .mpeg .3gp .vob .ogv .f4v
```

**For each file discovered:**
1. Upload via `POST /api/upload` (for browser-selected files) or provide path directly
2. Probe via `GET /api/probe?path=<path>` to get metadata
3. Add to the file queue in `appState.files`

**Validation Gate:**
- [ ] All files exist and are accessible
- [ ] All files probe successfully (have video streams)
- [ ] Total count is manageable (check available disk space for outputs)

---

### Step 2 -- Probe All Files and Analyze

Gather metadata for every file to inform grouping decisions.

**Per-file metadata:**
```json
{
  "codec": "h264",
  "width": 1920,
  "height": 1080,
  "fps": 29.97,
  "bitrate": 8500000,
  "duration": 120.5,
  "size": 127893504,
  "format": "mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2",
  "audioCodec": "aac"
}
```

**Aggregate statistics to compute:**
- Total input size (sum of all file sizes)
- Min/max/average bitrate
- Unique codecs present
- Unique resolutions present
- Total duration
- Estimated total output size

---

### Step 3 -- Group Files by Properties

Grouping helps identify files that need different treatment.

**Recommended groups:**

| Group | Criteria | Suggested Handling |
|-------|----------|--------------------|
| ProRes / Raw | codec = prores, rawvideo | Compress aggressively; expect 5-20x reduction |
| High-bitrate H.264 | codec = h264, bitrate > 15Mbps | Good compression candidates; H.265 balanced |
| Already-compressed | codec = h264/hevc, bitrate < 5Mbps | Skip or use `small` preset only |
| 4K+ | width >= 3840 | Consider downscaling to 1080p for delivery |
| Low-res | height <= 720 | Keep original resolution; scaling down further loses too much |
| Long-form | duration > 3600s | Monitor disk space; these produce large outputs |
| Short clips | duration < 10s | Fixed overhead may limit compression ratio |

**Per-file resolution override:**
The UI supports per-file resolution dropdowns via the `file.scale` property on each
file card. Use this to set different resolutions per group:
- 4K files -> scale to 1080p
- 1080p files -> keep original
- 720p files -> keep original

---

### Step 4 -- Configure Per-File Settings

The app applies the same codec/preset/format to all files in a batch, but resolution
can be set per file.

**Global settings (apply to all):**
- Codec: Set via codec selector buttons
- Preset: Set via quality preset buttons
- Format: Set via format selector buttons

**Per-file settings:**
- Resolution: Set via per-file dropdown on each file card
- The `file.scale` property is read during compression

**Recommended batch configurations:**

| Source Type | Codec | Preset | Format | Scale |
|-------------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| ProRes masters | H.265 | balanced | MP4 | 1080p |
| Camera footage (H.264 high-bitrate) | H.265 | balanced | MP4 | original |
| Screen recordings | H.265 | small | MP4 | original |
| Already-compressed delivery files | Skip | -- | -- | -- |
| Mixed for archival | AV1 | balanced | MKV | original |

---

### Step 5 -- Queue and Execute

Send the compression request for all pending files.

**How the batch is processed:**
1. The "Compress All" button iterates over all files with `status === 'pending'`
2. Each file sends an individual `POST /api/compress` request
3. Server adds each job to the PQueue
4. PQueue processes up to 4 jobs concurrently (tuned for M2 Max with dual encode engines)

**API request per file:**
```http
POST /api/compress
{
  "files": [{ "path": "<serverPath>", "name": "<filename>" }],
  "preset": "balanced",
  "codec": "h265",
  "format": "mp4",
  "scale": "original"
}
```

**Concurrency considerations for M2 Max:**
- 4 concurrent jobs is optimal for M2 Max (2 VideoToolbox encode engines + CPU headroom)
- SW encoding (libx264/libx265) is CPU-bound; 4 concurrent SW encodes may saturate CPU
- HW encoding (VideoToolbox) uses dedicated silicon; 4 concurrent HW encodes is fine
- Mixing HW and SW encoding works well; HW uses encode engines while SW uses CPU cores
- For AV1 (libsvtav1), reduce effective concurrency to 2 as it's very CPU-intensive

**Validation Gate:**
- [ ] All files have `status === 'pending'`
- [ ] Disk space sufficient for estimated total output
- [ ] Compress button is enabled and shows correct count

---

### Step 6 -- Monitor Batch Progress

Track all jobs via WebSocket updates.

**Progress tracking per job:**
```
WebSocket message: { type: "progress", jobId, percent, speed, fps, eta }
```

**Batch-level monitoring:**
- Count of completed / total jobs
- Files transition: `pending` -> `queued` -> `compressing` -> `done` / `error`
- Each file card shows individual progress bar with percentage, speed, and ETA
- Compress button shows spinner with count: "Compressing (N)..."

**Post-completion verification:**
- [ ] All jobs completed (no errors)
- [ ] Each output file exists
- [ ] Size comparison shown on each file card (original -> compressed, -X%)
- [ ] Total batch savings computed

## Error Handling for Batches

| Scenario | Behavior | Recovery |
|----------|----------|----------|
| One file fails, others succeed | Failed file shows error badge; others continue | Fix the failing file and re-add it |
| Disk space runs out mid-batch | Current job may fail; queued jobs will fail on start | Free space, remove partial outputs, re-queue |
| All files fail with same error | Likely a codec/format misconfiguration | Check compression settings and re-try |
| Server crashes mid-batch | WebSocket disconnects; auto-reconnect with exponential backoff | Restart server; re-add incomplete files |
| Browser tab closed | Jobs continue on server; progress lost in UI | Refresh page; check `GET /api/jobs` for status |
| Upload fails for some files | Those files show error status | Re-upload failed files individually |

                    |  |  |  |
                    v  v  v  v
                 [FFmpeg processes]
                    |  |  |  |
                    v  v  v  v
                 [WebSocket broadcast]
                    |
                    v
                 [Browser UI updates]
```

**Job lifecycle:**
`queued` -> `running` -> `complete` | `error` | `cancelled`

**Throttling:**
Progress events are throttled to 1 per second per job via a custom throttle function
to prevent WebSocket flooding during batch processing.
