# Code Reviewer Agent

Reviews Video Compressor code for quality, security, and compliance.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] File upload paths are sanitized (no path traversal)
- [ ] User input is validated before use
- [ ] No unsafe dynamic code execution
- [ ] Express routes have proper error handling
- [ ] File operations use safe paths (no `../` traversal)
- [ ] WebSocket messages are validated

### 2. ES Module Compliance
- [ ] Uses `import`/`export` (not `require`/`module.exports`)
- [ ] File extensions in imports (`.js`)
- [ ] `"type": "module"` in package.json
- [ ] No CommonJS patterns mixed with ESM

### 3. ESLint Compliance
```bash
cd "/Users/rishaal/CODING/CODED TOOLS/VIDEO COMPRESSOR" && npx eslint . 2>&1
```

### 4. Code Quality
- [ ] No unused variables or imports
- [ ] Consistent error handling (try/catch or .catch())
- [ ] Async functions properly awaited
- [ ] No memory leaks (event listeners cleaned up)
- [ ] WebSocket connections properly closed

### 5. Frontend Patterns
- [ ] DOM selectors match actual HTML IDs/classes
- [ ] Event listeners use proper delegation
- [ ] No global namespace pollution
- [ ] Theme-aware (uses CSS custom properties)

### 6. Backend Patterns
- [ ] Express middleware properly ordered
- [ ] Multer file upload limits set
- [ ] Temp files cleaned up after compression
- [ ] Process spawning uses proper error handling
- [ ] FFmpeg child processes are tracked and killable
